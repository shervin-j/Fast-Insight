# Fast-Insight
This is an old project of mine. You can give this application a CSV(Comma-separated values) file and it gives you the main statistical features of the data(e.g. items and their features for a store).

It also can plot Bar chart, Histogram, Scatter plot, and Pie chart for the given data.
